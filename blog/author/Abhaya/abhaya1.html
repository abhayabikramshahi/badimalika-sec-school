                        Kalikot District's Innovative Approach to Education: Night Classes at Badimalika Secondary
                        School
                    </h1>
                </div>
                <div class="descriptions">
                    <p>Badimalika Secondary School, located in Raskot municipality of Kalikot district, has recently
                        initiated night classes for its students. This initiative, part of a broader effort to improve
                        academic performance, particularly targets students preparing for the upcoming SEE examination.
                    </p>
                    <p>Under the leadership of Principal Pushparaj Baral, the school has started conducting these
                        special classes in the dormitory facilities, aiming to strengthen students' study habits and
                        academic results. The decision to conduct night classes follows the successful admission
                        campaign that significantly increased enrollment in government schools, demonstrating the
                        community's growing trust in public education</p>
                    <p>Headmaster Baral highlights that the introduction of night study sessions is intended to
                        cultivate a robust reading and learning culture among students. With many students typically
                        moving to cities for SEE exam preparation, the school's initiative offers a convenient and
                        cost-effective alternative. Utilizing the vacant class 10 classrooms, the school, with unanimous
                        support from its teaching staff, has decided to utilize this space effectively for night
                        classes.</p>
                    <p>Parents have expressed their support for this initiative, noting the reduced strain and expenses
                        compared to sending their children to the city for exam preparation. Jaya Bahadur Shahi, a
                        resident of Raskot Municipality Ward No. 1, commends the school's approach, suggesting that such
                        early and dedicated involvement by the school could lead to better educational outcomes and
                        improved quality of teaching.</p>
                    <p>Krishna Prasad Baral, a teacher at Badimalika Secondary School, attributes the ease of
                        implementing these night classes to the collective dedication of the teaching staff and the
                        headmaster's progressive mindset. The school, offering instruction in both Nepali and English,
                        stands as an exemplary model for educational innovation and commitment to student success. This
                        initiative is a testament to the potential of community schools in driving educational reform
                        and setting new benchmarks for academic excellence.
